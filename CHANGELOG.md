# Changelog

All notable changes to VAST G1-J5 are documented here.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

<!--
  Maintainers: jot user-facing changes under "[Unreleased]" as you work, grouped
  into Added / Changed / Deprecated / Removed / Fixed / Security. At release time,
  `npm run release -- <version>` promotes this section to a dated version heading,
  builds the app, zips dist/ into a release artifact (dist-v<version>.zip), and
  prints the git + `gh release create` steps to publish. Keep entries short and
  recognisable.

## [Unreleased]

## [1.5.1] - 2026-06-23

## [1.5.0] - 2026-06-23

### Added

- Per-drum sound design in the Drum Machine: every track now has **Tune**,
  **Decay**, **Tone**, **Drive**, **Pan** and volume controls in a selected-drum
  tuning strip, with a per-track **Reset**. Click a drum's name to audition and
  edit its sound. Tune now shapes **every** voice (kick, snare, hats, toms,
  clap), not just the pitched ones.
- **Drum kits**: a KIT picker with factory kits (808, 909, LoFi, Acoustic,
  Techno) plus a **Randomize** ("surprise me") button for instant new kits. Kit
  and per-drum tweaks save with presets and songs; existing presets/songs are
  unaffected.

## [1.4.0] - 2026-06-23

### Added

- Per-lane DJ mixer in the Song tab: **Mute**, **Solo**, and **Volume** for the
  Sequencer, Drums, and Sampler, so you can ride levels and drop lanes without
  switching machines. Solo isolates a lane (dimming the others); muting the
  Sequencer stops its notes while live keyboard play keeps going.

## [1.3.1] - 2026-06-22

### Added

- Custom bus compressors as AudioWorklets with gain-reduction meters: a
  1176-style FET compressor on the drum bus and an SSL-G-style VCA "glue"
  compressor on the master bus.
- Per-step settings (velocity, gate, probability, ratchet, tie) on the Drum
  Machine and Sampler, sharing the sequencer's step-hits math and edit UI; a
  choke model lets a shortened gate cut one-shots early and tie lets the last
  ratchet hit ring on. Legacy songs load unchanged.
- Per-step settings are now visualised directly on the step buttons of all three
  machines (gate width, velocity brightness, probability border, ratchet ticks,
  tie bridge).
- New demo songs (e.g. "Fat" v2 and "Run Away").

### Changed

- Demo songs are code-split into their own bundle chunk so app code and the
  rarely-changing demo data are cached separately.

### Removed

- The built-in "Knight Rider" demo song.

## [1.3.0] - 2026-06-22

- Baseline release. Covers the synth engine, FX chain, transport (clock,
  arpeggiator, 16-step sequencer, 8-track drum machine, 8-slot sampler),
  pattern banks, song chains, live DJ FX, song save/load, presets, and the
  in-app sample recorder/editor. See the git history prior to this changelog
  for the detailed evolution.
